# Scrum vs Kanban
This presentation constains the overview on Scrum and Kanban methodologies and their comparison.


# Agenda
1. Scrum methodology
2. Kanban methodology
3. Scrum and Kanban: similarities and differences

# Scrum methodology

Scrum is one of the most popular process frameworks for implementing Agile. Scrum follows a set of roles, responsibilities, and meetings that never change. Several of thems will be outlined below.

## Sprint
A Sprint, a time-box with usually lasts 2 weeks during which a useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous

## Sprint goal
A Sprint goal shows the desired outcome of an iteration that provides a shared goal to the team, which needs to be negotiated before every iteration.

# Scrum Artifacts

## Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is an ordered list of the new features, changes to existing features, bug fixes, infrastructure changes or other activities. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. If a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.

## Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. 

## Scrum board
A Scrum Board is a tool that helps Teams visualize Sprint Backlog. The board can take many physical and virtual forms but it performs the same function regardless of how it looks. The board is updated by the Team and shows all items that need to be completed for the current Sprint. 

## Burndown chart
A burndown chart represents all outstanding work. The backlog is usually on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal axis. A burndown chart can warn the team if things aren’t going according to plan and helps to show the impact of decisions. 

# Sprint ceremonies

## Sprint Planning
Before each sprint, the Product Owner presents the top items on the backlog to the team in a sprint planning meeting. The team then chooses which work they can complete during the sprint and moves the work from the product backlog to the sprint backlog.

## Daily Scrum meetings
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute stand-up meeting where each team member talks about their goals and any issues that have come up. The Daily Scrum happens every day during the sprint and helps keep the team on track.

## Sprint review meeting
At the end of each sprint, the team presents the work they have completed at a sprint review meeting. This meeting should feature a live demonstration. 

## Sprint retrospective meeting
Also at the end of each sprint, the team reflects on how well Scrum is working for them and talks about any changes that need to be made in the next sprint. The team may talk about what went well during the sprint, what went wrong, and what they could do differently.

# Roles in Scrum

## Product Owner
The Scrum Product Owner has the vision of what he or she wants to build and conveys that vision to the team.

## Scrum Master
Often considered the coach for the team, the Scrum Master helps the team do their best possible work. This means organizing meetings, dealing with challenges, and working with the Product Owner to ensure the product backlog is ready for the next sprint.
 
## Scrum Team
The Scrum Team is comprised of five to seven members. Everyone on the project works together and helps each other. 

# Kanban

## The main artifact is Kanban board which follows the following core principles.

### Visualize the workflow
A visual representation of work allows to understand the big picture and see how the flow of work progresses.
The board has different columns. Each column represents a specific activity that compose a “workflow”. Cards flow through the workflow until completion. It works together with the next core principle of Kanban:

### Limit work in progress (WIP)
Work in progress limits determine the minimum and maximum amount of work for each column on the board or for each workflow.

### Feedback Loops
Regular feedback loops are an important part of the Kanban system to compare expected results with actual outcomes and make adjustments. When implemented on a service delivery level, Kanban uses four feedback practices: the standup meeting; service delivery review; operations review and the risk review.

# Events
Kanban does not prescribe any specific events or meetings.

# Roles
Kanban does not prescribe any specific roles, such roles as Product Owner and Developer team can be outlined. 

# Comparison

As the main principles of both methodologies were outlined, they can be can compared.

## Similarities:
1. Both are focus on delivering the releasable software often and early.
2. Both need breaking the work into pieces.
3. Both are based on self-organizing teams.
4. Both release plan is continuously optimized and based on the empirical data (lead time/velocity).

## Differences
1. Scrum requires specific roles whereas Kanban has no required roles.
2. Scrum is based on timeboxed iterations, combining planning, process improvement, and release. In Kanban, you can choose to do these activities on a regular cadence or whenever you need.
3. A Scrum board is reset after each sprint. A Kanban board is continuously used.
4. Scrum teams require estimation, whereas Kanban does not.

# When to use Kanban and Scrum?
## Kanban
1. There is the need to add stories or change sprints on the fly.
2. There is no need for iterations.
3. Estimation is not necessary.
4. There is need for ability to release at any time.

Scrum can be less flexible than Kanban. 

## Scrum
1. For feature-driven work with big release goals or milestones.

In conclusion to the Kanban vs Scrum discussion, it is safe to say that they are different methodologies that appeal to different audiences. Where Scrum favors a more prescriptive process, Kanban leaves room for a more flexible workflow. But still they can be used either separately or in combination to suit best the development needs.
